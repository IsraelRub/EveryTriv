```

### Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd everytriv

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Wait for services to be healthy, then visit:
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# Backend API: http://localhost:3000
```

### Manual Setup

#### Backend Setup
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

#### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd client
npm install

## üéØ How to Use Custom Difficulty

### 1. Basic Usage
1. Select "Custom" from the difficulty dropdown
2. Enter your difficulty description in the text area
3. Use the suggestions for inspiration
4. Generate your trivia question

### 2. Writing Good Custom Difficulties

**‚úÖ Good Examples:**
- "high school chemistry level"
- "professional sports analyst knowledge"
- "university undergraduate biology"
- "beginner home cooking skills"
- "expert classical music theory"

**‚ùå Avoid These:**
- "hard" (too vague)
- "impossible" (not constructive)
- Very short descriptions
- Inappropriate content

### 3. Smart Features

**Topic-Specific Suggestions**: When you enter a topic, get tailored difficulty suggestions.

**History Feature**: Reuse your previous custom difficulty levels from the history panel.

**Validation**: Real-time feedback ensures your descriptions will work well.

## üìä API Endpoints

### Standard Endpoints
```http
POST /api/v1/trivia
GET /api/v1/trivia/leaderboard
GET /api/v1/trivia/score?userId={userId}
POST /api/v1/trivia/history
```

### Custom Difficulty Endpoints
```http
GET /api/v1/trivia/difficulty-stats?userId={userId}
GET /api/v1/trivia/custom-difficulty-suggestions?topic={topic}
```

### Example Custom Difficulty Request
```json
{
  "topic": "Physics",
  "difficulty": "custom:university level quantum mechanics",
  "userId": "user123"
}
```

## üèó Architecture

### Custom Difficulty Flow
1. **Frontend Validation** - Basic checks and suggestions
2. **Server Validation** - Content filtering and length validation
3. **LLM Processing** - Smart interpretation of custom descriptions
4. **Caching** - Efficient storage of generated questions
5. **Statistics** - Grouped tracking of custom difficulties

### Priority System
- **High Priority**: Expert/Professional/University level
- **Medium Priority**: Intermediate/High School level  
- **Low Priority**: Beginner/Elementary level

## üîß Development

### Adding New LLM Providers
1. Implement the `LLMProvider` interface
2. Add to the providers array in `TriviaService`
3. Update environment configuration

### Custom Difficulty Extensions
- Modify `getCustomDifficultySuggestions()` for new topic categories
- Update validation rules in `validateCustomDifficultyText()`
- Extend priority calculation logic

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Custom difficulties are stored with "custom:" prefix
CREATE TABLE trivia_history (
  id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
  topic VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  difficulty VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- Can be "easy", "medium", "hard", or "custom:description"
  -- ... other fields
);
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Custom Difficulty Not Working?**
- Check API key configuration
- Verify description length (3-200 characters)
- Ensure appropriate content

**Questions Too Easy/Hard?**
- Be more specific in your description
- Include context like "university level" or "beginner"
- Use the suggestions for inspiration

**Performance Issues?**
- Check Redis connection
- Monitor LLM API rate limits
- Verify database connection

## üö¶ Testing

### Testing Custom Difficulties
```bash
# Backend tests
cd server
npm run test

# Frontend tests  
cd client
npm run test
```

### Manual Testing Scenarios
