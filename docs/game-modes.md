# Game Mode Implementation for EveryTriv

This document outlines the implementation of game modes in the EveryTriv application.

## Game Modes

We've implemented three game modes:

1. **Time-Limited Mode**:
   - Default time limit: 60 seconds (configurable in 10-second increments)
   - Players must answer as many questions as possible within the time limit
   - A clock counts down remaining time
   
2. **Question-Limited Mode**:
   - Default question limit: 20 questions (configurable by the user)
   - Game ends after the set number of questions have been answered
   - A counter tracks remaining questions
   
3. **Unlimited Mode**:
   - No time or question limit
   - Continues until the user decides to stop
   - Limited by available tokens

## Key Components

### 1. GameModeUI Component
A modal interface allowing users to select their preferred game mode and configure settings.

### 2. GameTimer Component
A visual timer showing time elapsed for all modes, and time remaining for time-limited mode.

### 3. Game Component
Manages the active game state, handling question progression, game over conditions, and UI presentation.

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. User selects a game mode via GameModeUI
2. Game state is updated with the selected mode configuration
3. First trivia question is loaded
4. Game timer starts when question is displayed
5. After answering:
   - In time-limited mode: Continues until time runs out
   - In question-limited mode: Continues until question limit is reached
   - In unlimited mode: Continues until user stops
6. Game over screen is shown when mode conditions are met

### State Management
Game state has been extended to include:
- Current game mode
- Time and question limits
- Time elapsed and remaining
- Game over status

## User Experience

The implementation provides a more engaging and varied gameplay experience:
- Clear visual indicators of game progress
- Different gameplay strategies for different modes
- Increased replayability through varied challenges

## Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements:
- Leaderboards specific to game modes
- Achievements tied to specific game modes
- Additional game modes (e.g., sudden death, progressive difficulty)
